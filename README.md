# ui5-table-row regressiom

This repo documents a bug that was introduced in UI5 1.0.0-rc.3

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

`npm run build` builds the application to `public/bundle.js`, along with a sourcemap file for debugging.

`npm start` launches a server, using [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve).

`npm run watch` will continually rebuild the application as your source files change.

`npm run dev` will run `npm start` and `npm run watch` in parallel.
